# IfcOpenShell Examples

Series of examples on how to use IfcOpenShell https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell as a general-purpose IFC library.

Primary focus is on Python examples, with and without interface.
See the Wiki for more in-depth explanation for the different examples.

A second objective is to collect all examples into one, more comprehensive IFC-viewer.

**Note:** The library was originally written for PyQt5, but this (current) branch switches to PySide6. Console and basic GUI tools don't require many changes, but the Qt3D library has moved things around, making code incompatible between the two variants of PyQt/PySide, alas.
